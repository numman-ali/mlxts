# Agent eXperience Interface (AXI)

AXI defines ergonomic standards for building CLI tools that autonomous agents interact with through shell execution.
This local skill is adapted for `mlxts` from `https://github.com/kunchenguid/axi`.

## Before you start

Read the [TOON specification](https://toonformat.dev/reference/spec.html) before building any AXI output.

## 1. Token-efficient output

Use [TOON](https://toonformat.dev/) (Token-Oriented Object Notation) as the output format on stdout.
TOON provides about 40% token savings over equivalent JSON while remaining readable by agents.
Convert to TOON at the output boundary; keep internal logic on JSON.

```
tasks[2]{id,title,status,assignee}:
  "1",Fix auth bug,open,alice
  "2",Add pagination,closed,bob
```

## 2. Minimal default schemas

Every field in stdout costs tokens, multiplied by row count in collections.
Default to the smallest schema that lets the agent decide what to do next: typically an identifier, a title, and a status.

- Default list schemas: 3-4 fields, not 10
- Default limits: high enough to cover common cases in one call
- Long-form content belongs in detail views, not lists
- Offer a `--fields` flag to let agents request additional fields explicitly

## 3. Content truncation

Detail views often contain large text fields. Omitting them forces agents to hunt; including them wastes tokens.
Truncate by default and tell the agent how to get the full version.

```
task:
  number: 42
  title: Fix auth bug
  state: open
  body: First 500 chars of the issue body...
    ... (truncated, 8432 chars total)
help[1]: Run `tasks view 42 --full` to see complete body
```

- Never omit large fields entirely; include a truncated preview
- Show the total size so the agent knows how much is missing
- Suggest the escape hatch (`--full`) only when content is actually truncated
- Choose a truncation limit that covers most use cases, usually 500-1500 chars

## 4. Pre-computed aggregates

The most expensive token cost is often not a longer response; it is a follow-up call. If the backend has data that agents commonly need as a next step, compute it and include it.

**Aggregate counts**: include the total count in list output, not just the page size. Agents need "how many are there?" and will paginate if the answer is not definitive.

```
count: 30 of 847 total
tasks[30]{number,title,state}:
  1,Fix auth bug,open
  ...
```

**Derived status fields**: when the next step almost always involves checking related state, include a lightweight summary inline.

```
task:
  number: 42
  title: Deploy pipeline fix
  state: open
  checks: 3/3 passed
  comments: 7
```

Only include derived fields the backend can provide cheaply: a summary such as `3/3 passed`, not the full data.

## 5. Definitive empty states

When the answer is "nothing", say so explicitly. Ambiguous empty output causes agents to re-run with different flags to verify.

```
$ tasks list --state closed
tasks: 0 closed tasks found in this repository
```

State the zero with context. Make it clear the command succeeded; the absence of results is the answer.

## 6. Structured errors and exit codes

### Idempotent mutations

Do not error when the desired state already exists. If the agent closes something already closed, acknowledge and move on with exit code 0. Reserve non-zero exit codes for situations where the agent's intent genuinely cannot be satisfied.

```
$ tasks close 42
task: #42 already closed (no-op)    # exit 0
```

### Structured errors on stdout

Errors go to stdout in the same structured format as normal output, so the agent can read and act on them. Include what went wrong and an actionable suggestion. Never let raw dependency output leak through.

```
error: --title is required
help: tasks create --title "..." [--body "..."]
```

- Validate required flags before calling any dependency
- Translate errors; extract actionable meaning and discard noise
- Never leak dependency names; suggestions reference this CLI's commands, not the underlying tool

### No interactive prompts

Every operation must be completable with flags alone. If a required value is missing, fail immediately with a clear error. Suppress prompts from wrapped tools.

### Output channels

- stdout: all structured output the agent consumes, including data, errors, and suggestions
- stderr: debug logging, progress indicators, and diagnostics
- exit codes: 0 = success including no-ops, 1 = error, 2 = usage error

Never mix progress messages into stdout. An agent that reads "Fetching data..." will try to interpret it as data.

## 7. Ambient context via session hooks

Register the tool into the agent's session lifecycle so every conversation starts with relevant state already visible before the agent takes any action.

Pattern:

1. On first invocation, self-install hooks into the agent's configuration idempotently
2. At session start, a hook runs the tool and outputs a compact dashboard to stdout
3. The agent receives this as initial context and can act immediately

```
specs[2]{id,title,status}:
  1,Fix auth bug,open
  2,Add pagination,in-progress

help[2]:
  Run `mytool specs view 1` for details
  Run `mytool specs create --title "..."` to add a spec
```

Rules:

- Default app targets: support Claude Code and Codex by default when a tool can reasonably support both
- Self-installing: register hooks at global or user level on first run, without manual setup
- Portable commands: hook commands use a PATH-verified binary name when it resolves to the current executable, and fall back to the full absolute path otherwise
- Path repair: on every invocation, check existing hooks and update the executable path if it has changed
- Idempotent: repeated installs with the same path are silent no-ops
- Directory-scoped: show only state relevant to the current working directory
- Token-budget-aware: session context loads every time, so keep it minimal
- Lifecycle capture: session-end hooks capture what happened so future session-start context gets richer over time

How to integrate with each app:

- Claude Code: use native hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json` or project `.claude/settings.json`; prefer `SessionStart` to inject compact context via stdout
- Codex: use native hooks in `~/.codex/hooks.json` or `<repo>/.codex/hooks.json`, and ensure `[features].codex_hooks = true` in `config.toml`; prefer `SessionStart` for ambient context via stdout

## 8. Content first

Running a CLI with no arguments should show the most relevant live content, not a usage manual.
When an agent sees actual state it can act immediately. When it sees help text, it has to make a second call.

```
$ tasks
tasks[3]{id,title,status}:
  1,Fix auth bug,open
  2,Add pagination,open
  3,Update docs,closed
help[2]:
  Run `tasks view <id>` to see full details
  Run `tasks create --title "..."` to add a task
```

## 9. Contextual disclosure

Include a few next steps that follow logically from the current output.
The agent discovers the CLI surface area organically by using it, not by reading a manual upfront.

Rules:

- Relevant: after an open item, suggest closing; after an empty list, suggest creating; after a list, suggest viewing
- Actionable: every suggestion is a complete command or template carrying forward any disambiguating flags from the current invocation
- Parameterize dynamic values: use placeholders like `<id>` or `"<title>"` instead of guessing runtime values
- Omit when self-contained: when the output fully answers the query, suggestions are noise
- Guide discovery, not workflows: suggest possible next actions without prescribing a fixed sequence
- Reveal truncated lists: when a list shows only the most recent N items out of a larger total, add a help hint telling the agent how to see all of them
- Resolve errors: on errors, suggest the specific command that fixes the problem, not "see `--help`"

## 10. Consistent way to get help

The top-level home view also identifies the tool itself before the live data:

- Include the absolute path of the current executable, with the user's home directory collapsed to `~`
- Include a one-sentence description of what the AXI does

```
$ tasks
bin: ~/.local/bin/tasks
description: Manage project tasks in the current workspace
...
```

Every subcommand supports `--help` with a concise, complete reference: available flags with defaults, required arguments, and 2-3 usage examples. Keep it focused on the requested subcommand, not the entire CLI manual.
